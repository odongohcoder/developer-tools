**Shopify Developer Tools** is a macOS app that connects to your Shopify store(s) and allows you to make authenticated calls to the [Admin API](https://help.shopify.com/api/reference), generate dummy data, and view and customize [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/) components.

### Basics
- Press `control` + `option` + `s` to make Developer Tools visible (or bring it to focus) [above your active workspace](https://screenshot.click/06-13-yzhye-jugd7.jpg). Close the window with the same keys, or by using the standard macOS shortcut `command` + `w`
- When the app is in focus, press `command` + `f` at any time to focus on the search input
- Enter resource names, or app features to navigate to them:
  - `generator` to navigate to the data generator 
  - `get products count` to use the Admin API playground to get a count of all products in a store
  - `Layout` to view the Polaris `Layout` component
  - `profiles` to manage stores connected to Developer Tools 

### Authentication
Connect your Shopify store to Developer Tools to take advantage of the Admin API playground and data generator. You can login using your [development store](https://help.shopify.com/partners/dashboard/development-stores) credentials, or with an  [access token](https://help.shopify.com/api/getting-started/authentication/oauth).

### Data generator
